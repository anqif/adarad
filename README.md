# Adaptive Radiation Therapy
This is a Python package for large-scale adaptive radiation treatment planning over time (fractionation) via an ADMM-based operator splitting algorithm. It is an implementation of the method described in [A. Fu, L. Xing, and S. Boyd (2021)](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/adapt_rad_therapy.html).
